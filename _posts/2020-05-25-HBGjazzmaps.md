title: Jazz in Town

Being a long time jazz head, and analyst/social scientist on for my 9 to 5, I'm not surprised I came up with a map of Harrisburg's jazz clubs. A few queries on local Facebook groups, and conversations with our regional jazz society, turned up a good bit of information on where these clubs were, and who headlined at them.

The history is pretty rich for a small central Pennsylvania city.  But that's today. Seventy-five years ago jazz was more popular, and Harrisburg was more vibrant (it's slowly regaining steam today).
