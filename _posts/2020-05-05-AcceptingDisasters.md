title: Nature and Ego
---

The most recent posting of "Findings" in Harper's Magazine refers to what we might call the eventual triumph of nature over ego:

> An interdisciplinary team suggested that climate-driven societal collapse may stabilize once humans start accepting years with many disasters as the new normal. [^1]

Unfortunately, a good swath of the population, including certain political leaders whose rhetoric can seem more virulent than COVID-19 itself, continues to ignore nature. Just prior to COVID's emergence, David Wallace wrote in New York magazine a summary of so many natural disasters by increased global temperatures. Writing in June, Wallace noted that on average 20 tornadoes struck the midwest every day in May, on average. Meanwhile, the Mississippi continued to flood for its third month in a row. [^2] 

The ignorance is striking, although hardly surprising. Boardwalks in New Jersey have been rebuilt since hurricanes sunk them years ago; similarly for beach houses. The idea, or more deeply, the American impetus to operate as if there is no future to contend with is at play here. The motive echoes manifest destiny. Emerging from our political bodies from responding well to the current COVID pandemic.
