title: Nature and Ego
---

The most recent posting of "Findings" in Harper's Magazine refers to what we might call the eventual triumph of nature over ego:

> An interdisciplinary team suggested that climate-driven societal collapse may stabilize once humans start accepting years with many disasters as the new normal. [^1]

Unfortunately, certain political leaders' rhetoric seems more virulent than COVID-19 itself. The, as they continue to ignore nature. Just prior to COVID's emergence, David Wallace wrote in New York magazine a summary of so many natural disasters by increased global temperatures. Writing in June, Wallace noted that on average 20 tornadoes struck the midwest every day in May, on average. Meanwhile, the Mississippi continued to flood for its third month in a row. [^2] 

The ignorance is striking, although hardly surprising. The Trump administration's environmental policies, or its dismantling of them, are another tell-tale sign of it's handling of the pandemic. Just like tornados could be ignored, or hurricanes sharpied away, another force of nature was dealt a similar feint. This took the form of minimizing nature at many turns:

> We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. 
> Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that’s true. But we’re doing great in our country. [^3]

And so Trump's political impetus waddles on with nary a concern about contending with the future. Earlier denials were evident in the demise of so many environmental protections: rejection of the Paris accord, termination of protected lands, increased logging on public lands, rolled-back coal pollution regulations, etc. [^4]
