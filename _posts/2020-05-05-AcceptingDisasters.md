title: Nature and Ego
---

The most recent posting of "Findings" in Harper's Magazine refers to what we might call the eventual triumph of nature over ego:

> An interdisciplinary team suggested that climate-driven societal collapse may stabilize once humans start accepting years with many disasters as the new normal. [^1]

Unfortunately, certain political leaders' rhetoric seems more virulent than COVID-19 itself. Just prior to COVID's emergence, David Wallace wrote in New York magazine a summary of so many natural disasters catalyzed by increased global temperatures. Writing in June, Wallace noted that on average 20 tornadoes struck the midwest every day in May, on average. Meanwhile, the Mississippi continued to flood for its third month in a row. [^2] 

The ignorance is striking, although hardly surprising. The Trump administration's environmental policies, or its dismantling of them, are another tell-tale sign of how it would handle the pandemic. Just like tornadoes could be ignored, or hurricanes sharpied away, another force of nature was given the anti-science one-two. Other earlier denials were evident in the demise of so many environmental protections: rejection of the Paris accord, termination of protected lands, increased logging on public lands, rolled-back coal pollution regulations, etc. [^3]  

> We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. 
> Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that’s true. But we’re doing great in our country. [^4]

Trump's quotes about COVID parallel the kind of thinking that leads some to rebuild in the paths of hurricanes or the flood plains of might rivers.

And so Trump's political impetus waddles on with nary a concern about contending with the future.
