So many visualization platforms are available these days, and to my cap I place yet another feather: Flourish. 

For starters, at least.

Here is an example -- too simple, I'm afraid -- easily created from a free account:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4229585"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

As a fan of R, I am a little leery about creating graphics without having a piece of code that generates (and documents) my work. We'll see how this goes.  But I can easily update this chart at the Flourish website and the changes will appear here, as the embed link remains the same.
