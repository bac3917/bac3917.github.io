So many visualization platforms are available these days, and to my cap I place yet another feather: Flourish. 

For starters, at least.

Here is an example -- a simple stacked bar -- easily created from a free account:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4229585"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

As a fan of R, I am a little leery about creating graphics without having a piece of code that generates (and documents) the chart you see here. We'll see how this goes.  But I can easily update this chart at the Flourish website and the changes will appear here, as the embed link remains the same.

I grabbed these data from a rather robust wikipedia page (and spot checked some of the entries).  After scraping the many tables from wikipedia, I cleaned and munged them into a matrix with a row for each year and then a column for each administration. This structure is what Flouish needs to make a stacked bar -- different from R.

So, that goes something like this:

```
library(rvest)
disj<-read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_district_judges")
tbls <- html_nodes(disj, "table") # html_nodes acts as a CSS selector

tbls_ls <- tbls %>%  
  html_table(fill = TRUE)  # html_table parses tables

district<-tbls_ls[2:107]  # some subsetting
district<-bind_rows(district, .id = "iden")   # mash the list into a df
district<-district[ ,c(1,3:10)]  # yay!

```

I repeated these steps to scrape the appellate judges, then stacked the two dataframes into `usjudges`.  Finally, some matrix flipping and wrote to CSV for uploading to Flourish:

```
temp<-usjudges %>% dplyr::select(Born,Appoint2)
x<-temp %>% group_by(Born) %>% count(Appoint2)
x2<-x %>% pivot_wider(values_from = n,
                        names_from = Appoint2)
                        
write.csv(x2,"C:/path/path/judgesF.csv") # for flourish.com

```
