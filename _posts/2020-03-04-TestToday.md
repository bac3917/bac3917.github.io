Thousands is an apt term for American jazz if you're thinking about representing it with data. 

What musicians cut records with each other? Where did studios produce the most albums? When did bands overlap with studio
recordings? Social network analysis, maps and timelines correspond to these kinds of questions.

What you see here is the pilot phase of an ambitious project. While numerous websites store information about jazz albums and their artists who created them (like discogs.org) none permit for data analysis, manipulation, visualizations and/or extraction. When a full database of musicians, their albums, dates, studios and locations is developed, a great deal of questions can be thrown at it.
