title: Why JazzViz?

Thousands is an apt term for American jazz if you're thinking about representing it with data. 

What musicians cut records with each other? Where did studios produce the most albums? When did bands overlap with studio
recordings? Social network analysis, maps and timelines correspond to these kinds of questions.

What you see below is an example of <i>jazzviz</i> that I'm piloting. I'm likely to just continue dabbling in this and not take farther than just a series of posts. Regardless,  numerous websites store information about jazz albums and the artists who created them (like discogs.org). But none of these permit for data analysis, manipulation, visualizations and/or extraction. So, using R and other tools, I throw historical questions at these data.  Who played with whom?  When?  One example is shown below.  And more on this later.
